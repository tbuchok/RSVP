# What would you look like to learn about Ruby concurrency?
I'd like to hear what's going on the in space -- I don't have a very heavy CS background, but we use Ruby as our main language and I'm very interested to see/hear about using Ruby in other ways other than the standard web app patterns.

# What do you wish Ruby did better for concurrency?
As mentioned, I'm mainly interested to hear Jose speak and gain info from the rest of the attendees through discussions, questions, etc.
